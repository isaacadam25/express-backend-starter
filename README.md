# Express Backend Starter

Welcome to the Express Backend Starter repository! This starter template provides a solid foundation for building Node.js Express.js backend applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tsl-technologies/express-backend-starter.git

   ```

### Development

1. To start the development server and watch for changes, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm run watch
   ```
   This will run your Express.js server in development mode and automatically restart it when code changes are detected.

### Running the Application
